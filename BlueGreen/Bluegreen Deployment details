Installed an application called vote application with V3 & V4. 
Created the deployments in Parallel for v3 and v4 and tested both.
One using default service and another using adummy service.  
Then edited the service to point Green application using label selectors. 
Once Verified Green is working properly removed blue application to complete it.
